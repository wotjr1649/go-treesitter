// Compact-route decline census instrumentation.
//
// The scorecard test (TestAdmissionCandidateScorecard206) already sorts every
// registered language's full-parse admission attempt into PASS / DIVERGE /
// FALLBACK / SKIP / ERROR. Every FALLBACK carries a decline reason string, but
// two call sites collapse that reason before it reaches the caller:
//
//   - requireParserCoreFreshFullAcceptance folds every scheduler decline that
//     never reaches an accepted EOF head into one message, "did not accept
//     EOF", even though the compact scheduler already recorded a precise
//     boundary and detail in scheduler.receipt.Stop before returning;
//   - the same function folds every accepted-but-not-admissible head (wrong
//     token identity, an ambiguous multi-derivation frontier, a short byte
//     offset) into one message, "acceptance is not sole exact EOF".
//
// This file adds an opt-in classification layer that reads the receipt state
// already computed by the scheduler and renders a fine-grained mechanism
// class alongside the existing detail text. It is diagnostic-only plumbing:
//
//   - gated behind GTS_ADMISSION_CENSUS=1 (unset by default, so every
//     existing test and the scorecard's own default run see byte-identical
//     decline text to before this file existed);
//   - a single cached env read (sync.Once) on the decline path only, which is
//     already the cold, diagnostic path -- it never touches a successful
//     parse.
//
// The classification never changes what the compact route accepts, declines,
// or materializes. It only changes the text of an already-produced decline
// reason when an operator opts in.

// admissionCensusMechanism is the fine-grained decline mechanism class the
// coverage census ranks and aggregates per language.

// censusMechanismRecovery already tells an operator "only production

// against: the real-corpus recovery cohort is not one mechanism but four,
// and they sit in different B3 stages with different costs
// (spec.compact-recovery-ownership.v1 section 4). This classification splits
// the cohort the way C's own ts_parser__handle_error / ts_parser__recover
// split it, so the census reports which stage owns each declining row.
//
// Evaluation order mirrors C exactly, because C's mechanisms are tried in a
// fixed order and the first one that applies is the one that runs:
//
//  1. missing-token insertion (ts_parser__handle_error step 2,
//     parser.c:2154-2230; the Go port is cHandleError's missingTokenSearch,
//     parser_recover_c.go);
//  2. strategy 1, the stack-summary resume election (ts_parser__recover's
//     summary scan, cRecoverStrategy1Election); C runs this for every
//     non-error lookahead INCLUDING end-of-file;
//  3. the end-of-file whole-file wrap (ts_parser__recover's recover_eof,
//     cRecoverEOFAccept);
//  4. strategy 2, error-region absorb (ts_parser__recover's skip_token tail,
//     cAbsorbTokenIntoError).
//
// Every probe below is READ-ONLY. It reads action rows and walks recorded
// link adjacency; it publishes no record and mutates no header. In
// particular it deliberately does NOT run the compact analogue of C's step 1
// (s3CloseInProgressProductions), which performs real reductions and appends
// arena records: a diagnostic classification must not change what the parse
// did. The consequence is stated in the shape's own name -- the scan happens
// at the declining state, not at C's post-closure state -- so a row whose
// missing-token opportunity only appears after closure classifies here as a
// later mechanism. That is a floor on the missing-token cohort, never an
// overcount.
//
// Read the answer as "the mechanism that owns THIS decline point", not "the
// only mechanism this source needs". A source can require several recovery
// mechanisms in sequence, and the compact route reports only the first point
// at which it gave up. Measured on the shipped real corpus: widening the
// native strategy-2 owner to four uncertified grammars opened twenty error
// regions and still graduated no row, because each row went on to reach an
// end-of-file wrap, a missing-token insertion, or an error-mode lex
// disagreement that strategy 2 does not own. Use this classification to size
// and order the stages, not to predict a per-row graduation.
