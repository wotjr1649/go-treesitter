// OutlineSymbol is one entry of a language-neutral file outline: a definition
// the tags query captured, its normalized kind, its name, its spans, and the
// definitions lexically nested inside it.
//
// The projection is read-only. It never changes the tree and never copies a
// definition body; Name and Owner are the only text it extracts.
type OutlineSymbol struct {
	// Kind is the normalized definition kind. It comes from the
	// "@definition.X" capture suffix through one fixed, language-neutral
	// table (outlineKindTable) plus one fixed node-type refinement table
	// (outlineKindRefinement). It never comes from the language name.
	Kind string
	// Name is the text of the "@name" capture, with leading and trailing
	// white space removed. A "#strip!" directive on the capture applies,
	// because the text comes from QueryCapture.Text.
	//
	// Invariant: NameRange is the span of the capture NODE, so Name and the
	// source bytes at NameRange agree only when no directive rewrote the
	// text and the node carries no surrounding white space. Trimming or a
	// directive can make Name shorter than NameRange.
	// TestOutlineNameAgreesWithNameRange pins that agreement on every
	// committed fixture, so a language where the two diverge shows up as a
	// test failure rather than as a silently wrong span.
	Name string
	// NodeType is the grammar node type of the captured definition node.
	NodeType string
	// Range is the full span of the captured definition node.
	Range Range
	// NameRange is the span of the "@name" capture node. It is always
	// contained in Range; a candidate that breaks containment is omitted and
	// counted.
	NameRange Range
	// Owner is the non-lexical owner name, for example the receiver type of
	// a Go method. It is set only when a declarative OutlineOwnerRule
	// attached through WithOutlineOwnerRules matches this symbol's NodeType
	// and resolves a single identifier; otherwise it is "". Lexical
	// containment never sets Owner -- that information lives in Children.

	// order. Nesting comes from byte containment of Range, never from the

// never appear in the outline, however many such definitions the file holds.

	// This is the common shape when shared tags patterns bind "@name" twice
	// on one definition node. In C-family method syntax the two bindings are
	// the return type and the method name, and no language-neutral rule can
	// tell them apart. Choosing by capture order would publish the return
	// type as the method name, so the outline drops the group instead and
	// counts it here. The remedy is a data edit: constrain the pattern with
	// a "name:" field, the way the Go tags override already does.
	OmittedNameConflict int

	// This rule is defensive. Two nodes of one tree are always nested or
	// disjoint, so a partial overlap cannot arise from a single tree today.
	// The rule keeps the forest well-defined if a future capture source
	// relaxes that, and the unit cases exercise it directly.
	OmittedOverlap int
	// OmittedInvalidNameRange counts candidates whose NameRange is not byte
	// contained in Range, or whose Range is itself inverted. Like
	// OmittedOverlap this is defensive: the captures of a match all sit
	// inside the matched subtree, so a single tree does not produce this
	// today.
	OmittedInvalidNameRange int
	// OmittedMultipleDefinitions counts matches dropped because they carry
	// more than one "@definition.X" capture. Such a match names two
	// definitions at once and the outline does not choose between them.

	// edit that introduces the shape is visible instead of silent.

	// OwnerRuleMisses counts symbols where an owner rule matched the node

	OwnerRuleMisses int
	// DeclineReason names why the outliner produced nothing, or is empty
