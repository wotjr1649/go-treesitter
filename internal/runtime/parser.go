// Parser reads parse tables from a Language and produces a syntax tree.
// It supports GLR parsing: when a (state, symbol) pair maps to multiple
// actions, the parser forks the stack and explores all alternatives in
// parallel while preserving distinct parse paths. Duplicate stack
// versions are collapsed and ambiguities are resolved at selection time.
//
// Parser is not safe for concurrent use. Use one parser per goroutine, a
// ParserPool, or guard shared parser instances with external synchronization.

// HasError OR propagates the error through the reduce-built ancestors above
// it, all the way to the tree root. Python's root-level convention (the now-
// retired syntheticRootCanDropError / pythonModuleChildrenLookComplete pair,
// parser_result_root_build.go / parser_result_python.go) used to break
// exactly that propagation for EXTRA children: it skipped extra children
// before checking their HasError, so this leaf -- extra by construction, see
// leaf.setExtra(true) below -- could still be silently dropped at the python
// module root even though it correctly carries HasError=true. PR #636 fixed
// the check to look at HasError on every child, extra or not, before the
// extra-skip; the fix then proved the whole drop mechanism inert (measured:
// consulted thousands of times, actionable on a handful, and wrong every
// time it acted) and the mechanism was deleted outright
// (elm/synthetic-root-drop-retirement), so this leaf's error status now
// reaches the root unconditionally, like any other.
//
// This is an ACCOUNTING fix, not a shape fix: the skipped bytes now have a
// span and HasError=true, matching C tree-sitter's verdict that the
// construct is erroneous. The leaf's own shape still diverges from C's for
// the same stray in two ways that remain open follow-up work: the span
// covers the whole lexer-skipped gap (which can include trivia C would not
// attribute to the stray), and the leaf is childless where C typically wraps
// the stray token as a child of its own ERROR/error_repeat node. Closing that
// gap needs re-lexing the skipped bytes to find the stray token's true
// bounds and giving the leaf that token as a child, which needs its own
// verification pass and is out of scope here.

// (parser_result.go) is clear-only, and language normalizers call
// setHasError(false) on repaired regions, so a tree can report a clean
// root while a descendant is still IsMissing() (observed for python and
// wgsl). Do not treat a false root bit as an exactness proof.
//
// Why a false start stays safe despite under-set trees:
//  1. Reuse admission checks the per-node hasError()/zero-width gates
//     (incremental.go), so a MISSING leaf cannot be spliced directly.
//  2. The languages observed to produce under-set trees carry external
//     scanners that disable subtree reuse entirely, so their cost-bearing
//     content never enters this parse.
//  3. The pair-local backstop in glr.go (cost competition still runs when
//     either merge candidate is cPaused or has cRec != nil) guards the
//     residual case. Do not remove that guard on the strength of this
//     starting flag.
//
// A false result is therefore not "assume clean" -- it is "no reusable
// error content can enter, so let this pass's own explicit set-true sites
// (missing-token insertion, error-run leaves, resync recovery,
// cHandleError, ...) do exactly what they already do for a fresh full

// kotlinObjectLiteralConflictChoice resolves issue #93: the bundled Kotlin

// have. Completing it lets a top-level `object Foo { ... }` parse as
// infix_expression(object_literal, simple_identifier, lambda_literal) — the
// bare `object` becomes an anonymous-object expression, `Foo` an infix
// operator, and the body a trailing lambda — instead of object_declaration.
//
// At a shift/reduce conflict that offers that bodiless object_literal reduce
// alongside a shift, prefer the shift. Shifting keeps the parser on the
// declaration path (`object Foo { ... }` -> object_declaration) or, in value
// position, on the object_literal-plus-class_body path (`val x = object { }`
// -> object_literal(class_body)). It never completes a bodiless object_literal,
// so the infix misparse can't form. The anonymous-with-supertype and named
